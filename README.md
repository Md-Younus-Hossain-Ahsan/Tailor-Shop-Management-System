## Motivation Behind the Project

- **Doctors' sloppy handwriting:** Sloppy handwriting by doctors poses serious risks, leading to potential harm or even death for patients. Clear and legible documentation is crucial for ensuring patient safety in healthcare. [Reference Link](https://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1578074,00.html)
- **Prescription Continuity Challenge:** Sometimes patients forget to bring the previous prescription at the time of their next appointment, which poses challenges in creating subsequent prescriptions.

Introducing the "**Medicine Prescribing System**," designed to address the challenges posed by doctors' sloppy handwriting and the prescription continuity dilemma. This system streamlines the prescription process, ensuring accuracy, legibility, and seamless prescription management for enhanced patient safety.

## System Requirements

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Framework:** Java Swing
- **Database:** MySQL

## Key Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface using Java Swing for efficient interaction.

- **Prescription Management:** Doctors can easily prescribe and manage medications for patients, including commonly prescribed medicines and tests.

- **Patient Details:** Store and retrieve comprehensive patient details, making it convenient for doctors to access relevant information.

- **Prescription History:** Track and review the prescription history of patients to make informed decisions during consultations. If a patient forgets their previous prescription, our system allows the doctor to quickly find and review it, ensuring a smooth and informed medical consultation.

- **Searching Suggestions:** During prescription creation, our system offers smart searching suggestions by retrieving medicine, test, finding problems, and advice lists from the database, streamlining the process for doctors.
